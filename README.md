# Wildescape - Survive to Escape

**Wildescape** is an exciting adventure survival game. The player takes on the role of a government agent who wakes up in the middle of a dense forest with no memory of his previous life.

His basic survival instincts are intact, but what the young agent doesn't know is that a secret agency has been tracking him for a long time and has placed him in this world to test his survival skills. The objective of the game is to survive ten days on the first level, after which the player advances to the next level with a different environment, such as a desert, jungle, and other ecosystems.

During the game, the player will need to gather resources, craft tools and weapons, build shelters, and endure harsh conditions. The player can consume food and water to maintain energy and hydration. Additionally, players expend calories and dehydrate during activities, adding realism to the game.

Chopping wood, gathering items, and crafting are key activities for survival. Currently, the first level has been created, which does not include interactions with animals. In future levels, players will interact with animals, further challenging their survival.

The player will also be able to consume the meat of animals they hunt, which will help them maintain their energy.

The game was developed for the university competition FIT CC 2024 in Mostar, where I collaborated with my friend Mirnes Muratspahic. The rest of the game can be found on his profile, and the trailer will be provided below.
